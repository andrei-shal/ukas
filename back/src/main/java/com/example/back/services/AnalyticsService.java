The user might have intended to ask something, but the text is garbled. I should inform them that their message didn't come through correctly and ask them to rephrase or provide more details. Maybe in English, since they might be able to switch languages if needed.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the question marks are intentional, but that seems unlikely.
